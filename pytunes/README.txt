This was an attempt to make an MP3 player. 

It's called pytunes because I thought that that was a funny play on python/iTunes.

Pygame does not handle MP3s perfectly, and so some will cause the program to crash.
Sometimes this seems to be caused by songs with irregular kb/s, but not always.

Playlist creation has not been implemented in the GUI, but is has in teh shell.

Requires many non-standard modules.
